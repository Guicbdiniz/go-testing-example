# Go Testing Example

Project developed for the first activity of the **Software Testing** subject attended in 2022/2.

The idea was simply to demostrante a testing package/framework selected by me.

I choose the **Go Testing** package, which is part of the **Go Standard Library**.

I used a simple integer calculator structure with all of the four major math operations to showcase the package.
